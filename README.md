# Reversing-a-string
Reverse a string: Reversing a string means replacing the last element in the first position and vice versa and doing it for all characters in a string.A string whose reverse string is same as the original string is called a pallindrome.

Reversing a string using for loop:-In this approach, we have one variable pointing at the first index and one at the last. In each step we swap both characters, increment the first variable and decrement the second variable until the first is less than the second one.

Algorithm of the program:-

1.Start the program.

2.Take a string as input.

Declare two variables pointing to the first and last index of the string.
4.Swap the characters at their places and increment variables pointing to first character and decrement variable pointing to last character.

5.Do it until the first variable is less than the second one

6.Print the reversed string

7.End the program
